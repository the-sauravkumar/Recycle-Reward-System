This project deploys a backend system, an NFT canister, and a React-based frontend to the Internet Computer blockchain.

## Project Overview

- **Backend Canister**: Handles core backend functionalities.
- **NFT Canister**: Manages the creation and ownership of NFTs.
- **Frontend**: React-based user interface served as a static asset canister.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for npm commands)
- [DFX SDK](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install) installed and configured
- Internet Computer identity and cycles wallet to deploy to the mainnet

---

## Local Deployment Instructions

1. **Start the DFX Replica in Background**:
   ```bash
   dfx start --background --clean
   ```

2. **Deploy the Canisters Locally**:
   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

3. **Run the Frontend Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

---

## Mainnet Deployment Instructions

1. **Build the React Frontend**:
   Make sure your React application is built before deploying:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy to the Internet Computer (Mainnet)**:
   Use the following command to deploy all canisters (backend, NFT, and frontend) to the mainnet:
   ```bash
   dfx deploy --network=ic
   ```

---

## Canister Details

- **Backend Canister**: `recycle_backend`
  - Language: Motoko
  - Path: `src/recycle_backend/main.mo`

- **NFT Canister**: `nft`
  - Language: Motoko
  - Path: `src/NFT/nft.mo`

<<<<<<< HEAD
- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor

- **Frontend Canister**: `recycle_frontend`
  - Type: Assets
  - Path: `src/recycle_frontend/dist`

## Parameters for NFT Canister

The NFT canister supports the following parameters:
- **`name`**: (Type: `Text`) Name of the NFT.
- **`owner`**: (Type: `Principal`) Owner's principal ID.
- **`content`**: (Type: `[Nat8]`) Content of the NFT in binary format.

---

## Notes

- Ensure your `dfx.json` is correctly configured before deploying.
- Use sufficient cycles in your wallet to cover the cost of deploying canisters to the Internet Computer mainnet.
